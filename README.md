<h2>üåç Project Description</h2>

This analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset sourced from **Kaggle**, which simulates real-world sales data for a multi-national retail organization. The data covers thousands of transactions across various product categories, customer segments, and countries over multiple years.

The project follows a full end-to-end data analytics workflow:

- Data cleaning and preparation in **Microsoft Excel**
- Data modeling, relationships, and DAX measures in **Power BI**
- Dynamic visualizations and KPI reporting for strategic insight

<h2>üßπ Data Cleaning & Structuring</h2>

The raw CSV file was cleaned and preprocessed using Excel to ensure data consistency and integrity. Key cleaning steps included:

- Removing duplicates and blank rows  
- Dropping unnecessary columns  
- Formatting date and currency fields  
- Creating structured Excel tables for modular analysis

After cleanup, **pivot tables** and **primary keys** were created for the following entities:

- **Customers**
- **Products**
- **Locations**
- **Orders**

These tables were later linked to the main **Sales Table** to form a relational data model suitable for Power BI.

<h2>üì• Power BI Integration & Modeling</h2>

Once the data structure was finalized in Excel, it was imported into Power BI. Key steps in this phase included:

- Defining **relationships** between tables (one-to-many joins)
- Creating calculated **DAX measures** such as:
  - `Total Sales`
  - `Total Profit`
  - `Profit Margin (%)`
- Building interactive visuals using:
  - **Cards** (for KPIs)
  - **Donut charts** (for category-wise distribution)
  - **Bar & Line charts** (for trends)
  - **Slicers & Filters** (for user-driven exploration)
